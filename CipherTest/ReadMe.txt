    CONSOLE APPLICATION : CipherTest Project Overview
========================================================================

This project is designed to test a students capability to research (currently)
3 different cipher algorithms and be able to put there problem solving skills
to solving the problem. 

If the program complains about the standard libraries being missing then you 
will have to install the Windows SDK Version that you are trying to use. 

You can check that at:
Project -> Test Properties -> General -> Windows SDK Version

An alternative way would be to hit the drop down box on the Windows SDK Version
and try another if it is present.
